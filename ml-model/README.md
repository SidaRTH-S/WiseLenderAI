# WiseLenderAI - ML Model Service

## Overview

WiseLenderAI ML Model Service is a standalone REST API responsible for generating an **Alternative Credit Score** and predicting the **probability of loan default** using multiple machine learning models.

Unlike traditional credit scoring systems that rely only on historical credit bureau records, this service evaluates an applicant from three independent perspectives:

* **Financial Intelligence**
* **Behavioral Intelligence**
* **Digital Trust Intelligence**

The outputs from these models are combined using a weighted ensemble to generate a final lending decision.

# Backend Notes

* Send data as JSON.
* Numeric values must be sent as numbers.
* Strings are case-sensitive.
* Do not send engineered scores.
* The API generates engineered scores internally.
* Missing required fields will return HTTP 422.

# Developer Notes

## Backend

* Validate categorical values exactly as documented.
* Reject unknown categories with **HTTP 422**.
* Do **not** expect engineered features (`verification_score`, `communication_score`, etc.) in the request. These are generated internally by the ML service.
* Numeric fields should be sent as JSON numbers (`int` or `float`).

## Frontend

* Use dropdowns for all categorical fields.
* Use number inputs for numeric fields.
* Use sliders for percentage fields (`dti`, `revol_util`, `bc_util`) if desired.
* Binary flags (`0`/`1`) can be represented as switches, radio buttons, or yes/no dropdowns.
* Ensure the values sent to the API exactly match the allowed strings listed above, including capitalization and spacing.
